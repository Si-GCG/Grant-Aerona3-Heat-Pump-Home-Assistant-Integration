# Weather Compensation Guide - Save Money on Your Heating Bills

> **The complete guide to using weather compensation with your Grant Aerona3 to save 10-15% on heating costs**

Weather compensation is the smartest feature of your heat pump - it automatically adjusts your heating to be as efficient as possible based on the weather outside. This guide explains everything in plain English so you can start saving money immediately.

## 💰 **Why Weather Compensation Saves Money**

### The Problem Without Weather Compensation
Most heating systems send the same temperature water to your radiators whether it's -5°C or +10°C outside. This wastes enormous amounts of energy on mild days.

**Example: Traditional fixed temperature heating**
- **Cold day (-5°C)**: 45°C water needed → COP 2.8 → 3.5kW power for 10kW heating
- **Mild day (10°C)**: 45°C water sent anyway → COP 2.8 → 3.5kW power for 6kW heating needed
- **Result**: Paying for 10kW of heating when you only need 6kW!

### The Solution With Weather Compensation
Your heat pump automatically sends cooler water on mild days, maintaining perfect comfort while using less electricity.

**Example: Weather compensation**
- **Cold day (-5°C)**: 45°C water → COP 2.8 → 3.5kW power for 10kW heating
- **Mild day (10°C)**: 35°C water → COP 3.8 → 2.4kW power for 6kW heating
- **Result**: Perfect comfort with 30% less electricity on mild days!

### Real Money Savings
**Annual heating bill comparison**:
- **Without weather compensation**: £1,200/year
- **With weather compensation**: £950/year  
- **Annual saving**: £250/year 💰
- **Payback time**: Immediate (no cost to enable)

## 🌡️ **How Weather Compensation Works**

### The Heating Curve
Weather compensation uses a "heating curve" - a mathematical relationship between outdoor temperature and the water temperature sent to your heating system.

```
Outdoor Temperature  →  Flow Temperature  →  Result
-8°C (very cold)     →  45°C (hot water)   →  Maximum heating
-3°C (cold)          →  42°C              →  High heating  
2°C (chilly)         →  38°C              →  Medium heating
7°C (cool)           →  34°C              →  Low heating
12°C (mild)          →  30°C              →  Minimal heating
16°C+ (warm)         →  Off               →  No heating needed
```

### Automatic Operation
Once set up, weather compensation works completely automatically:
1. **Measures outdoor temperature** from heat pump's outdoor sensor
2. **Calculates optimal flow temperature** using your heating curve
3. **Adjusts water temperature** sent to radiators/underfloor heating
4. **Maintains perfect comfort** while minimising electricity use

### Why It's Brilliant
- **No manual adjustments** needed - works 24/7 automatically
- **Immediate response** to weather changes
- **Perfect comfort** maintained at all times
- **Maximum efficiency** for every outdoor condition
- **Works with any heating system** - radiators, underfloor heating, or both

**Symptoms**: House overshoots target temperature on mild days
**Solution**: Decrease min flow temperature by 2-3°C
- Try 32°C instead of 35°C
- Monitor comfort for a few days
- Decrease further if comfortable (down to 28°C minimum)

#### **If Weather Compensation Seems Slow**
**Symptoms**: Takes hours to adjust to weather changes
**Solution**: Steepen the heating curve
- Increase the difference between min and max flow temperatures
- Example: Change from 35-45°C to 32-48°C
- This makes the system more responsive to weather changes

#### **If Bills Are Still High**
**Symptoms**: Expected savings not materialising
**Solution**: Lower overall temperatures
- Reduce both min and max flow temperatures by 2°C
- Example: 35-45°C becomes 33-43°C
- Monitor comfort - you might be surprised how little difference it makes

## 🔥 **Boost Mode - Extra Heat When Needed**

Sometimes you need more heat than weather compensation provides. That's where boost mode comes in.

### When to Use Boost Mode
- **Very cold snap** (-10°C or below) 
- **House guests** expecting extra warmth
- **Recovery heating** after being away
- **Illness** requiring higher temperatures
- **Special occasions** needing guaranteed comfort

### How Boost Mode Works
1. **Switches to boost curve** - typically 8-10°C hotter than normal curve
2. **Temporary operation** - usually 2-4 hours maximum
3. **Automatic return** to normal weather compensation
4. **Higher electricity use** but guaranteed extra warmth

### Activating Boost Mode

#### **Manual Boost** (Recommended)
1. **Find boost switch**: `switch.grant_aerona3_weather_compensation_boost`
2. **Turn ON** for immediate boost
3. **Set duration**: Usually 2 hours default
4. **Monitor temperature** - should see increase within 30 minutes

#### **Automatic Boost** (Advanced)
Set up automation to activate boost automatically:
```yaml
# Example automation
automation:
  - alias: "Auto Boost in Extreme Cold"
    trigger:
      - platform: numeric_state
        entity_id: sensor.grant_aerona3_outdoor_temperature
        below: -8
        for: 
          hours: 1
    action:
      - service: switch.turn_on
        entity_id: switch.grant_aerona3_weather_compensation_boost
        data:
          duration: 180  # 3 hours
```

### Boost Mode Best Practices
- **Use sparingly** - reduces overall efficiency
- **Limited duration** - maximum 4 hours at a time  
- **Monitor COP** - will drop during boost but should recover
- **Plan ahead** - better to adjust main curve than rely on boost

## 🏠 **System-Specific Optimisation**

### Underfloor Heating Systems

#### **Why UFH is Perfect for Weather Compensation**
- **Low temperature operation** (28-40°C) = high COP
- **Thermal mass** provides even heat distribution
- **Gradual response** matches weather compensation perfectly

#### **Optimal Settings for UFH**
```
Min Outdoor: -8°C → Max Flow: 38°C
Max Outdoor: 16°C → Min Flow: 28°C
```

#### **UFH-Specific Tips**
- **Start lower** - UFH works at surprisingly low temperatures
- **Be patient** - thermal mass means slower response times
- **Zone differently** - bedrooms can be 2-3°C cooler
- **Night setback** works brilliantly with UFH thermal mass

### Traditional Radiator Systems

#### **Optimising Radiators for Weather Compensation**
- **Larger radiators** = lower temperatures = higher COP
- **TRVs (thermostatic valves)** help balance system
- **Bleeding** radiators improves heat transfer

#### **Optimal Settings for Radiators**
```
Min Outdoor: -8°C → Max Flow: 45°C  
Max Outdoor: 16°C → Min Flow: 35°C
```

#### **Radiator-Specific Tips**
- **Check radiator sizing** - undersized radiators need higher temperatures
- **Consider upgrades** - larger radiators pay for themselves in efficiency
- **Balance system** - all radiators should get warm together
- **Insulate pipes** - reduces heat loss, improves efficiency

### Mixed Systems (UFH + Radiators)

#### **Challenges with Mixed Systems**
- **Different temperature requirements** - UFH needs 30°C, radiators need 45°C
- **Mixing valves** or separate zones needed
- **More complex control** but still worthwhile

#### **Solutions for Mixed Systems**
1. **Zone control** - separate weather compensation for each system type
2. **Mixing valves** - blend down temperature for UFH zones  
3. **Priority systems** - optimise for largest heating load
4. **Professional design** - may need heating engineer input

## 🎯 **Troubleshooting Weather Compensation**

### Common Problems and Solutions

#### **Weather Compensation Not Responding**
**Symptoms**: Flow temperature stays constant regardless of outdoor temperature

**Diagnostic Steps**:
1. **Check WC switch** is definitely ON
2. **Verify outdoor sensor** reading realistic temperature
3. **Check heating demand** - WC only works when heating is needed
4. **Test manually** - change setpoint and watch response

**Solutions**:
- **Enable WC** if switched off
- **Clean outdoor sensor** if reading incorrectly  
- **Turn heating on** if in summer mode
- **Check wiring** if sensor readings impossible

#### **Home Too Cold with Weather Compensation**
**Symptoms**: House doesn't reach target temperature, especially on cold days

**Diagnostic Steps**:
1. **Check flow temperature** on coldest day - is it reaching maximum?
2. **Monitor COP** - if below 2.0, may be system problem
3. **Compare comfort** with fixed temperature equivalent
4. **Check heat pump capacity** vs house heat loss

**Solutions**:
- **Increase max flow temperature** by 3-5°C
- **Enable boost mode** for very cold periods  
- **Professional check** if COP consistently low
- **Home insulation** improvements may be needed

#### **Bills Not Reducing as Expected**
**Symptoms**: Weather compensation enabled but no obvious savings

**Analysis Required**:
1. **Compare like-for-like** periods (same months previous year)
2. **Check COP improvement** - should average 0.3+ higher
3. **Monitor flow temperatures** - should be varying significantly
4. **Verify settings** - may be too conservative

**Optimisation Steps**:
- **Lower flow temperatures** more aggressively
- **Extend outdoor temperature range** (down to -10°C, up to 18°C)
- **Check home improvements** may allow lower temperatures
- **Professional energy audit** if savings still not apparent
